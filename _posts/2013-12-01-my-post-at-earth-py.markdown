title: My post at earthpy.org about interpolation of geographical data
---

While I was browsing earthpy tutorials I've encountered a post about interpolation using `basemap` module. And there I've commented about another way of doing it 
(using `scipy.spatial.cKDTree`) and was invited to show an example. So that has resulted in the following <a href="http://earthpy.org/interpolation_between_grids_with_ckdtree.html">post</a>.
