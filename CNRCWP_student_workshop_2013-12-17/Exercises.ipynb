      "0. Write a script that prints `Hello world` and launch it from command line.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Write a function called `post_message` with one positional argument (message) and a named argument (author, default should be your name), when `message = \"Hello\"` and `name = \"xxx\"` the function should print \"xxx says: Hello\". Use format method of the builtin string class.\n",

      "2. Save the function `post_message` to the file `post_helper.py` and then call this function from another file `do_post.py`\n",

      "1. Create 20 objects of class Person with name and age fields. Put them into a list and print sorted by name, sorted by age\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dates are immutable, hence they are hashable and can be used as keys in a dictionary. For example to save a field corresponding to a given date one would do: ```mydict[the_date] = field```. Which is handful for caching. Implement a recursive version of the fibonacci function, which given an index will return the corresponding fibonacci number.\n",
